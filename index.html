    <h1>Welcome to the Excel 2015 Giving Circle</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_circle" target="_blank">giving circle</a> is when people pool money together, decide where to give the money, and make a positive impact through donations while also learning about community and philanthropy.</p>
      <p>Other Excel cohorts have done this annually quite successfully, with participation rates of over 90% and collectively giving thousands of dollars to effective organizations that they care about.</p>
      <p>We believe that Excel 2015 is a remarkable group of people with strong insight into effective charitable giving and the fortunate financial position to be able to contribute to a giving circle.</p>
      <p>For 2021, we’re aiming for an <strong>80%+ participation rate, with a recommended donation of $100 per person</strong>.</p>
      <p>This site will serve as a landing page for general information and updates.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>Where is the money going?</h3>
      <p>We don’t know yet! We’ll decide this together through a process where we optionally submit individual one-slide grant proposals, briefly present them in a group meeting, then vote afterwards for our top organisations. This will occur after we build a collective pool of funds, and the details will be clearly communicated shortly.</p>
      <p>The intention for this process is for us to collectively discuss and engage with the topics and questions of where to give, rather than us fundraising for a specific cause or organization.</p>
      <p>Our collective funds could be split amongst multiple organizations through approval of multiple grants, depending on our collective decision making.</p>

      <h3>What is the expected time commitment?</h3>
      <p>We will have an initial one hour meeting with all participants to describe next steps, then another one hour meeting to review proposals. So minimum 2hrs per year, maximum 3-4hrs per year if you would like to prepare a grant proposal or get involved further.</p>

      <h3>Why donate money?</h3>
      <p>Money is power, and can be leveraged effectively to do enormous good.</p>

      <h3>Why participate and donate specifically with Excel 2015?</h3>
      <p>Diversity of knowledge from our cohort of impressive individuals will allow us to learn and grow as individuals and donate effectively as a group.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Giving Circle is a great opportunity to get together and stay in touch.</p>

      <h3>What are the specific decision making mechanics?</h3>
      <p>It's not fully determined yet, but it will be well specified and covered in our first meeting. We respect your time and opinions, and are committed to presenting a fair, clear, and decisive process for proposing and deciding upon grants.</p>

      <h3>Can I match donations using my company's corporate matching policies?</h3>
      <p>Yes! If your company has corporate matching, it's very likely that FJC is already internally approved or can be internally approved as eligible for matching.</p>

      <h3>Are my donations tax-deductible?</h3>
      <p>Yes - tax receipts for donations will be provided via email to all donors.</p>

      <h3>What are the eligible organizations for our future grants?</h3>
      <p>501(c)(3) organizations are eligible (searchable <a href="https://501c3lookup.org/" target="_blank">here</a>), as well as international organizations, although these may incur additional FJC fees.</p>

      <h3>What is FJC's fee structure?</h3>
      <p>FJC charges a 2% flat fee on incoming donations, as well as an additional 2% fee for PayPal and 2.25% fee for Credit Cards. No further fees are incurred for holding money in the account or granting funds. This is among the lowest fees for Collective Giving Accounts.</p>

      <h3>Who to contact with further questions?</h3>
      <p>Contact Leo and Meital with any other questions.</p>
